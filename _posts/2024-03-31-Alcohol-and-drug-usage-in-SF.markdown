# Introduction to data set (PENDING)

The dataset corresponding to San Francisco Police Reports includes incidents filed by police officers or citizens from 2003 to 2018. Containing data varying from geolocation of the crimes, date and time, to type of crime, this dataset carefully provides insights on how crime behaves in San Francisco for the given years, allowing us to deep dive in an interesting topic: alcohol and drug abuse in San Francisco.

We will try to understand how substance abuse has behaved in San Francisco, by showing different visualizations that one can easily identify patterns and insights from.

# General overview

As a starter, we want to have a general overview on the ocurrence of alcohol and drugs related crimes reported in San Francisco from years 2003 to 2017.

Analyzing the following calendar plot for the focused crimes per each day available in the dataset leads us to easily detect some interesting patterns. 

* First, a peak in these crimes is easily observed during the years 2008 and 2009. This can be attributed to the financial crisis and recession that the United States was sustaining during these years, resulting in an increase of alcohol and drug usage. As mentioned in this article [^Crisis], financial crises are motivators that can lead to an increase in alcohol non-healthy consumption as a coping mechanism to psychological distress, which can be triggered specially by unemployment and income reductions.

* Highest rates are always during the first three months of the year, coincidentally, during winter. Winter conditions can have a huge impact on our psychology and behavior. Environmental factors, social isolation, holidays, and Seasonal Affective Disorder are some of the contributors to an increased substance usage, and could set a case for a deeper study on this topic [^Winter].
